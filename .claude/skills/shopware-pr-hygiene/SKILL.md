# Shopware PR Hygiene

Keep PR metadata predictable.

## Rules

- Follow `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md` closely.
- Do not add extra PR description sections such as a separate validation section.
- Use a conventional PR title when requested, for example `fix: allow TestBootstrapper to activate Composer plugins`.
- After review feedback or CI failures, create a follow-up commit explaining that specific fix. Do not amend or force-push existing commits unless the user explicitly asks.
