### 6.0.0 EA1 (2019-07-17)

**Additions / Changes**

* Added `JoinBuilderInterface` and moved join logic from `FieldResolver` into `JoinBuilder`
* Added getJoinBuilder to `FieldResolverInterface`
* Fixed Twig template loading for the theme system. Twig files from themes will only be loaded if the theme is active
 for the requested sales channel.
* Added `active` column to `theme` entity.
* Improved theme lifecycle handling. Themes will be set to inactive if deactivated/uninstalled. Config will be reloaded
  when a theme is updated. Themes will automatically be recompiled if the plugin is updated.
* Improved loading/refresh of theme.json. You can now change the theme.json and use `bin/console theme:refresh` to
  reload the configuration.
[View all changes from v6.0.0+dp1...v6.0.0+ea1](https://github.com/shopware/platform/compare/v6.0.0+dp1...v6.0.0+ea1)
* Added Twig filters `sw_encode_url` and `sw_encode_media_url` to Storefront. Contrary to Twig's `url_encode` filter it encodes every segment of the path rather than the whole url string.
You can use them with every URL in your templates
```
{# results in http://your.domain:8080/path%20to/file%20with%20whitspace-and%28brackets%29.png #}
<img src="{{ "http://your.domain:8080/path to/file with whitspace-and(brackets).png" | sw_encode_url }}"

{# encodes the url of your media entity #}
<img src="{{ yourStorefrontMediaObject | sw_encode_media_url }}
```
* We added the `$path` property to the `WriteCommandInterface`. With this you can track your commands initial position in the request.
This can be useful when validate your commands in `PreWriteValidateEvent`s when the commandqueue is already in write order.
