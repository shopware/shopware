## Project overview

To discover the features of Shopware and what sets us apart from other e-commerce systems, take the [feature tour](https://www.shopware.com/en/products/product-tour/) on the Shopware home page.

From a developer's perspective, here are some highlights that make Shopware easy and fun to work with:

### Platform and Framework

Shopware itself is based mainly on [Symfony](https://symfony.com/what-is-symfony) and [VueJS](https://vuejs.org/). It is a fully functional e-commerce platform, but it is also an **e-commerce framework**.

Shopware is:

- a ready-to-use [shopping cart system](https://docs.shopware.com/en/shopware-6-en/getting-started).
- a vendor dependency in your [flex project](https://developer.shopware.com/docs/guides/installation/template).
- [API-first](https://developer.shopware.com/docs/guides/integrations-api).
- [extensible through plugins](https://developer.shopware.com/docs/guides/plugins/plugins/plugin-base-guide):
  - Harness the full power of Symfony by creating bundles and loading them as part of the application.
- [extensible through apps](https://developer.shopware.com/docs/guides/plugins/apps/app-base-guide):
  - A modern, lightweight but powerful way to add functionality, requiring very little Shopware-specific knowledge.
- headless if you need it to be.

## Installation

### Extending Shopware

There are already a lot of extensions available in the [Shopware store](https://store.shopware.com/).

After setting up [Shopware locally for development](https://developer.shopware.com/docs/guides/installation), you can start with our extension guides in the documentation.

The preferred way of extending Shopware is through the [App System](https://developer.shopware.com/docs/guides/plugins/apps/app-base-guide). If the feature you want to implement needs direct access to the Shopware process and the database, you can also use the [plugin system](https://developer.shopware.com/docs/guides/plugins/plugins/plugin-base-guide).    
You can find an [overview and differentiation in the documentation](https://developer.shopware.com/docs/concepts/extensions).

### Production setup

The easiest way to run a Shopware shop is booking a commercial plan in the [Shopware cloud](https://www.shopware.com/en/shopware-cloud/), a fully managed setup, ready to use.

The recommended way for on-premise shops is installing Shopware [through the flex template](https://developer.shopware.com/docs/guides/installation/template). To unlock the full potential Shopware has to offer, [commercial plans](https://www.shopware.com/en/pricing/) are also available for on-premise.   
These plans enrich your shop with unique functionality, giving you an additional advantage over your competition.

There is a list of [hosting partners](https://www.shopware.com/en/partner/hosting/), who offer a pre-installed shop, making your start a lot faster.

We also provide a [web-based installer](https://www.shopware.com/en/download/), the [documentation](https://docs.shopware.com/en/shopware-6-en/first-steps/installing-shopware-6?category=shopware-6-en/getting-started) walks you through the necessary steps.

#### Contribution setup

There are multiple ways to get an installation running, the way with the fewest steps involved is using the contribute image from [dockware](https://dockware.io/), a community maintained docker setup by the Shopware agency [dasistweb](https://www.dasistweb.de/en/).
