## Under the hood


The build-in **Shopware 6 Storefront** is based on [Twig](https://twig.symfony.com/doc/3.x/templates.html)
and [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.2/getting-started/introduction/).
Two well known and easy to learn frameworks, making the creation of templates a breeze and bringing many advantages for merchants & developers:

* Lightweight and fast storefront
* Works perfectly on all end devices
* Reduced costs & effort required to make customisations, thanks to being built upon basic code & development standards that can be easily and widely used
* Flexible basis for creating your own custom themes
* Clear product presentation ‚Äì filter according to properties and variants
* Numerous sorting options for product lists in the storefront
* Customer ratings can be handled conveniently in the administration and easily published in the storefront


[![](https://s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/shopware-platform-assets/github-platform/readme/storefrontT.png)](https://s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/shopware-platform-assets/github-platform/readme/storefront.png)

Together with our friends of [VueStorefront](https://github.com/vuestorefront) we also provide an open source PWA frontend called [**"Shopware PWA"**](https://github.com/vuestorefront/shopware-pwa):<br />

**What makes Shopware PWA unique:**

* Quick integration & drop-in replacement for standard storefront
* Unrestricted creativity for frontend developers
* Modern tech-stack
* Made for enterprise-level complexity

The **Shopware 6 Administration** is based on [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/) and [twig.js](https://github.com/twigjs/twig.js/wiki),
making the creation of new modules fast and easy.
Get started with the [design documentation](https://shopware.design/).

## Extension-system

## Demo

You can easily setup shopware by:

* [Download](https://www.shopware.com/en/download/#shopware-6) shopware and run it on your server
* using [Dockware](https://dockware.io/)
* or simply setup a [cloud shop](https://www.shopware.com/en/download/#create-onlineshop) and tryout everything

## Technology

Shopware 6 uses Symfony as the standard framework, while the administration is completely based on Vue.js. In relying on technological standards, we‚Äôve made it even easier to work with Shopware ‚Äì while reducing dependency on specialised knowledge. Our goal is to make it as comfortable as possible to get started with Shopware by providing you with various resources, completely free of charge.

### API First
We want commerce to take place where people are; independent of place, time and end device. Following to the API-first approach, Shopware 6 provides retailers with the technological foundation to effortlessly build retail strategies across channels and devices.

![The core architecture](https://s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/shopware-platform-assets/github-platform/readme/platformcontext.svg)

The chart shows how the Shopware Platform fits into your enterprise.
It provides web frontends for management and for commerce through a multitude of sales channels.
It comes with a set of user facing interfaces and provides the ability to connect to your own infrastructure and outside services through REST-APIs.

More information can be found [in the documentation](https://developer.shopware.com/docs/concepts/api).

## Shopware 6 repository structure

Shopware 6 consists of multiple repositories, two of them are important to you:

- `shopware/platform` is a [mono repository](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/monorepos)
    - This is where the shopware core is developed. You need it as dependency in your projects
    - This is where you can participate in the development of Shopware through pull requests
    - It's split into multiple repositories for production setups, all read-only
- A template based on Symfony flex, which you can use to start your own project
    - **This is where your journey with shopware starts**
    - Installation see below!

## Quickstart / Installation

A full installation guide covering different dev environments is available in the [docs](https://developer.shopware.com/docs/guides/installation).

*For the impatient reader, here is a tl;dr using docker and symfony cli.*

Let's start by creating a new project:

```bash
> composer create-project shopware/production:dev-flex project
```

You now have the application template for the Shopware Platform in the directory `project`, we now change into it:

```bash
> cd project
```

Now we start our service containers:

```bash
> docker compose up -d
```

And install Shopware with the following command:

```bash
symfony console system:install --basic-setup --drop-database --create-database -f
```

Start the webserver:

```bash
symfony server:start -d
```

To be sure that the installation succeeded, just open the following URL in your favorite browser: [localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000/)

[Now you're all set to start developing your first plugin.](https://developer.shopware.com/docs/guides/plugins/plugins/plugin-base-guide)

## Roadmap

### You make the roadmap!

Shopware 6 will continue to evolve together with you and your feedback. This is our number one priority!

With openness as one of our core values, we will always provide you with a transparent overview of our product development.
The Shopware Roadmap shows you what we are working on, what we want to tackle next, and what visions we have for the future.

[Take a look at the current roadmap here.](https://shopware.com/en/roadmap/)

## Our community is our strongest asset

In today‚Äôs information-based world, you cannot thrive in closed systems. Black boxes and vendor lock-in models hurt innovation ‚Äì and belong in the dark ages of ecommerce.

The future of IT is all about collaboration. At Shopware, we believe that the best ecommerce solution can only be developed in constant exchange with the people that use it every day. This is why we made a clear promise to the open source approach and embrace everyone willing to participate. We consider our community to be our greatest strength; not our competitor, like many companies tend to do.

We believe that our open source edition is our strongest asset and that we need, now more than ever, to invest in our ecosystem of partners and developers. So that we can work together to collaborate across backgrounds, experiences and ideas and mutually benefit from the software that results.

### Installation of Shopware for contributors

The installation process is slightly different for working on the platform. It's not necessary to create a new project and install the platform as a dependency. Instead, we will work on it directly.

Let's start by cloning the platform repository

```bash
> git clone git@github.com:shopware/platform.git shopware-platform
```

Change directory into our newly cloned project:

```bash
> cd shopware-platform
```

Install the Composer dependencies

```bash
> composer update
```

Now we start our service containers:

```bash
> docker compose up -d
```

Now, set up the Shopware environment with the following command:

```bash
> ./bin/console system:setup
```

URL to your /public folder should be: `http://localhost:8000`

For the database details, use the following:

Host: 127.0.0.1
User: root
Password: root
Database: shopware

At the end, the system will create a `.env` file containing the provided configuration.

Now we install Shopware with:

```bash
> composer setup
```

This will run the migrations, install dependencies and build the assets.

Start the webserver:

```bash
symfony server:start -d
```

To be sure that the installation succeeded, just open the following URL in your favorite browser: [localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000/)
