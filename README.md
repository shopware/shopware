# Shopware Platform
This mono repository is a library of all shopware components. It does not represent a real product, nor a running version of shopware. To test the technologies you can checkout the development template `shopware/development` to create a running instance for local development.

## Contributing
If you want to commit code changes you can only do this to this repository. This mono repository will forward the changes to the repositories of each component. Please also check our [contribution guidelines](https://developers.shopware.com/community/contribution-guideline/) before committing new code. For more information about local development please have a look at the [Readme.md](https://github.com/shopware/development) file of the development template at `shopware/development`.
