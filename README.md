## Take a glimpse

The **Shopware 6 Storefront** is based on [Twig](https://twig.symfony.com/doc/2.x/templates.html)
and [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/getting-started/introduction/).
Two well known and easy to learn frameworks, making the creation of templates a breeze!

The **Shopware 6 Administration** is based on [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/) and [twig.js](https://github.com/twigjs/twig.js/wiki),
making the creation of new modules fast and easy.
Get started with the [design documentation](https://shopware.design/).

The Rulebuilder makes the implementation of business processes easy.

More information can be found [in the documentation](https://docs.shopware.com/en/shopware-platform-dev-en/internals).

## Shopware 6 repository structure

Shopware 6 consists of multiple repositories, two of them are important to you:

- `shopware/platform` is a [mono repository](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/monorepos)
  - This is where the shopware core is developed. You need it as dependency in your projects
  - This is where you can participate in the development of Shopware through pull requests 
  - It's split into multiple repositories for production setups, all read-only
- [`shopware/development`](https://github.com/shopware/development) is the development template
  - **This is where your journey with shopware starts**
  - Installation see below!

## Quickstart / Installation

A full installation guide covering different dev environments is available in the [docs](https://docs.shopware.com/en/shopware-platform-dev-en/getting-started/installation-guide).

*For the impatient reader, here is a tl;dr using docker.*

Let's start by cloning the development template:

```bash
> git clone git@github.com:shopware/development.git
```

You now have the application template for the Shopware Platform in the directory `development`, we now change into it:

```bash
> cd development
```

and clone the platform repository into its default directory `platform`. *Note This is important for autoloading purposes.*

```bash
> git clone git@github.com:shopware/platform.git
```

Build and start the containers:

```bash
> ./psh.phar docker:start
```

Access the application container:

```bash
> ./psh.phar docker:ssh
```

Execute the installer:

```bash
> ./psh.phar install 
```

This may take a while since many caches need to be generated on first execution, but only on first execution.

To be sure that the installation succeeded, just open the following url in your favorite browser: [localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000/)

[Now you're all set to start developing your first plugin.](https://docs.shopware.com/en/shopware-platform-dev-en/internals/plugins/plugin-quick-start?category=shopware-platform-dev-en/internals/plugins)

## Roadmap

### You make the roadmap!

Shopware 6 will continue to evolve together with you and your feedback. This is our number one priority!

With openness as one of our core values, we will always provide you with a transparent overview of our product development.   
The Shopware Roadmap shows you what we are working on, what we want to tackle next, and what visions we have for the future.

[Take a look at the current roadmap here.](https://shopware.com/en/roadmap/)

## Our community is our strongest asset

In todayâ€™s information-based world, you cannot thrive in closed systems. Black boxes and vendor lock-in models hurt innovation â€“ and belong in the dark ages of ecommerce.

The future of IT is all about collaboration. At Shopware, we believe that the best ecommerce solution can only be developed in constant exchange with the people that use it every day. This is why we made a clear promise to the open source approach and embrace everyone willing to participate. We consider our community to be our greatest strength; not our competitor, like many companies tend to do.

We believe that our open source edition is our strongest asset and that we need, now more than ever, to invest in our ecosystem of partners and developers. So that we can work together to collaborate across backgrounds, experiences and ideas and mutually benefit from the software that results.
