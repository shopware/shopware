# 6.7.0.0
## Introduced in 6.5.7.0
## New `technicalName` property for payment and shipping methods
The `technicalName` property will be required for payment and shipping methods in the API.
The `technical_name` column will be made non-nullable for the `payment_method` and `shipping_method` tables in the database.

Plugin developers will be required to supply a `technicalName` for their payment and shipping methods.

Merchants must review their custom created payment and shipping methods for the new `technicalName` property and update their methods through the administration accordingly.
