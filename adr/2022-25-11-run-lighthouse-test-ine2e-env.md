## Context
The Lighthouse test ran in the `APP_ENV=prod`, this meant that also AdminQueueWorker was active, which is recommended to not be used in real prod setups.

## Decision
Use `APP_ENV=e2e` for lighthouse tests, to deactivate the admin worker. After removing enqueue lighthouse ran int o timeouts when the admin worker was used, this solves this problem also. 
Besides that it should lead to much more realistic results.

## Consequences
This means that the lighthouse tests won't run in the real `prod` env anymore, but the main difference between the two envs is that in `e2e` env the admin worker is deactivated, which is probably closer to "real" production setups.
The only other difference is that all rate limits are deactivated in the `e2e` env, but this is not relevant for the lighthouse tests.
