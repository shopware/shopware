# 2022-11-16 - Deprecate the Storefront CSRF implementation

## Context

* With browsers evolving and dropping support for older browser in 6.5 we have wide support for SameSite cookies.
* The current CSRF implementation adds a lot of complexity to all forms and ajax calls in the Storefront.
* The CSRF protection does not add a great improvement in security due to the SameSite strategy.

## Decision

* We remove the CSRF protection in favor of SameSite cookies which are used and prevent CSRF attacks already.

## Consequences

* All CSRF implementations in the Storefront will be removed.
