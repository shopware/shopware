# Core
* Changed the type of the `$priceCalculator` argument in the `ProductCartProcessor` class to 
  `AbstractProductPriceCalculator` to allow decorating the price calculator as described
   [in the official documentation](https://developer.shopware.com/docs/guides/plugins/plugins/checkout/cart/customize-price-calculation#decorating-the-calculator)
