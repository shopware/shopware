# Core
* Changed `EntityExistsValidator` and `EntityNotExistsValidator` to work in combination with composite constraints like Symfony's `All` constraint by cloning the criteria object.
* Changed `EntityNotExistsValidator` to only be valid, if the expected entity does not exist.
* Changed `EntityExistsValidator` and `EntityNotExistsValidator` to only include one entity in the result as that is enough to determine exists for non `id` property searches.
