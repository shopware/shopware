# Core
* Changed skip state of `\Shopware\Core\Framework\DataAbstractionLayer\Indexing\EntityIndexingMessage` that is sent from `\Shopware\Core\Content\Product\DataAbstractionLayer\ProductIndexer::update` to skip stock updates and inheritance updates as this has been done right before sending message
