title: Change storefront tab styling
issue: NEXT-10255
---
# Storefront
* Changed in `src/Storefront/Resources/app/storefront/src/scss/skin/shopware/component/_tab-menu.scss`
    * Removed background color of `.nav-link:active` and `.nav-link:hover` in `_tab-menu.scss` to make a transparent background color for storefront tab.
    * Added background color to `.nav-link:hover` to set tab hover background color 20% darker compared to background color of body.
