# Administration
* Changed `sw-single-select__selection-input` display to `None` if the single selection field is not selected.
* Changed `min-height` and `padding` for the `sw-single-select` field to keep the old dimensions
* Changed styling for elements under `sw-condition` (inside the rule builder) to use the full height
