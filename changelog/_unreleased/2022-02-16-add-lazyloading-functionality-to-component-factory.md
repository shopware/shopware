# Administration
* Changed Vue-Adapter behavior to create lazy Vue components
* Added `async-component-factory` with lazy component support
* Deprecated old `component.factory`
* Changed `template.factory` to support async resolution of templates
* Changed global `Shopware.Component` values to the new, `async-component.factory`
* Changed feature flag loading behavior so that it can directly be used in the boot process
