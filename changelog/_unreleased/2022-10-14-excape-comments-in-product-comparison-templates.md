# Core
* Changed `src\Administration\Resources\app\administration\webpack.config.js` comment removal to escape {#- -#} because it is necessary for correct creation of CSV Product Comparison Templates (because of this comments Twig ignores the trailing newline)
* old: search: /\{#[\s\S]*?#\}/gm,
* new: search: /^(?!\{#-)\{#[\s\S]*?#\}/gm (still remove comments, but skip if they are in this combination "{#-" )
