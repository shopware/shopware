# Administration
* Added `errorArrow` computed in `/module/sw-flow/component/sw-flow-sequence-action/index.js` to show the error arrow.
* Added `isValidAction` computed in `/module/sw-flow/component/sw-flow-sequence-action/index.js` for checking invalid action.
* Added `sw-flow-sequence-action-error` component for showing the unknown action.
* Added `showActionWarning` computed in `/module/sw-flow/view/detail/sw-flow-detail-flow/index.js` to display the warning alert if there is a invalid action.
