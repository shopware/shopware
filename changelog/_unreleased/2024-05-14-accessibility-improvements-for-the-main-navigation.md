# Storefront
* Added "focusin" and "focusout" events to the main navigation to improve accessibility.
* Changed the flyout elements positions, to improve the tab order.
* Removed a not needed loop in TWIG (only loop once through the nav tree).
* Changed `$menu-flyout-zindex` from `750` to `1030` behind `ACCESSIBILITY_TWEAKS` flag to make sure it is displayed above opened Bootstrap dropdowns.

To use it you need to add the flag `ACCESSIBILITY_TWEAKS=1` to your `.env` file.
