# Core
* Changed description of `lint` command to fix grammar issues
* Added new possible changelog section `# Elasticsearch` to the changelog linter
* Changed regexes in the changelog linter to be more precise and simple
* Changed the changelog creator to always prepend the GitHub username with an `@` symbol
