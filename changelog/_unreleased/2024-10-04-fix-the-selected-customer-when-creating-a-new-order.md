# Administration
* Changed method `navigateToCreateOrder` in `sw-customer-detail-order` component to pass the customer ID as a query parameter instead of passing the customer object as a route param.
* Changed method `createdComponent` in `sw-order-create-initial` component to load the customer object by ID instead of reading the customer object from route params.
