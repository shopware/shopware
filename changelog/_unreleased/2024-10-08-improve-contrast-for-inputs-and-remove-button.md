# Storefront
* Changed `$focus-ring-opacity` to `0.6` to improve contrast.
* Changed `$focus-ring-width` to `0.2rem` to make it less heavy because of the increased contrast.
* Changed `$input-placeholder-color` to `#666977` to improve contrast.
* Changed `line-item-remove-button` to `btn-outline-secondary` in `Resources/views/storefront/component/line-item/element/remove.html.twig` to improve contrast.
