# Core
* Removed default for hasAvailableFilter in `SalesChannelProductDefinition`
* Changed `AdminProductStreamController` to not filter for visibility if there is a visibility filter in request
* Changed `sw-sales-channel-products-assignment-dynamic-product-groups` to use `productStreamPreviewService` instead of regular product api
