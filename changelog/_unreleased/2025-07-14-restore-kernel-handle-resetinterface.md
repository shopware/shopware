# Core

* Changed `Shopware\Core\Kernel` to restore support for Symfony's `ResetInterface` by adjusting the `boot()` method and preserving a minimal `handle()` override.
* Removed redundant logic in `Kernel::boot()` that prevented Symfony's reset lifecycle from executing correctly.

# Upgrade Information

## Better support for long-running runtimes

If you are running Shopware in a long-running environment (e.g., FrankenPHP or RoadRunner),
this change enables Symfony to properly reset services implementing `ResetInterface` between requests.
No configuration changes are required.
