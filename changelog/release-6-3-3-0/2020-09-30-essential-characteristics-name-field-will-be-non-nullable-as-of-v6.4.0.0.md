# Upgrade Information

## `name` attribute of `ProductFeatureSetTranslationDefinition` will be non-nullable

With [NEXT-11000](https://issues.shopware.com/issues/NEXT-11000), the `name` attribute in
[ProductFeatureSetTranslationDefinition](https://github.com/shopware/platform/blob/master/src/Core/Content/Product/Aggregate/ProductFeatureSetTranslation/ProductFeatureSetTranslationDefinition.php)
was marked non-nullable. This change is also implemented on database-level with
[Migration1601388975RequireFeatureSetName.php](https://github.com/shopware/platform/blob/master/src/Core/Migration/Migration1601388975RequireFeatureSetName.php).
For blue-green deployment compatibility, the now non-nullable field will have an empty string as default value.
