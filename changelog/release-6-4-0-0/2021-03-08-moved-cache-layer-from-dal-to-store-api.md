# Core
* Changed caching mechanic inside the core. The cache layer was moved from the DAL to the store api routes and some other internal services
* Added cache layer for rule loading
    * Added `AbstractRuleLoader`, which is the base class for the `RuleLoader`
    * Added `CachedRuleLoader`, which adds a cache around the rule loading
* Added cache layer for request domain resolving
    * Added `AbstractDomainLoader`, which is the base class for the `DomainLoader`
    * Added `CachedDomainLoader`, which adds a cache around the domain loading
    * Added `CachedDomainLoaderInvalidator`, which invalidates the cache for the domain loading
    * Added `DomainLoader`, which is responsible to provide all existing domains. This domains are used to detect which domain is requested in an incoming request
* Added cache layer for shipping method store api route
    * Added `CachedShippingMethodRoute`, which adds a cache around the shipping method loading
    * Added `ShippingMethodRouteCacheKeyEvent`, which is triggered when the cache key for the route is generated
    * Added `ShippingMethodRouteCacheTagsEvent`, which is triggered when the cache item is written, and the attached tags are determined 
* Added cache layer for product suggest store api route
    * Added `CachedProductSuggestRoute`, which adds a cache around the product suggest route
    * Added `ProductSuggestRouteCacheKeyEvent`, which is triggered when the cache key for the route is generated
    * Added `ProductSuggestRouteCacheTagsEvent`, which is triggered when the cache item is written, and the attached tags are determined
* Added cache layer for product search store api route

    * Added `ProductSearchRouteCacheTagsEvent`, which is triggered when the cache item is written, and the attached tags are determined
    * Added `ResolvedCriteriaProductSearchRoute`, which resolves the criteria before the cached route is called. This way the route gets a resolved criterion and does not have to listen to all request parameters. 
* Added cache layer for product listing store api route
    * Added `CachedProductListingRoute`, which adds a cache around the product listing route
    * Added `ProductListingRouteCacheKeyEvent`, which is triggered when the cache key for the route is generated

* Added cache layer for currency store api route
    * Added `CachedCurrencyRoute`, which adds a cache around the currency loading of a sales channel 
    * Added `CurrencyRouteCacheKeyEvent`, which is triggered when the cache key for the route is generated
    * Added `CurrencyRouteCacheTagsEvent`, which is triggered when the cache item is written, and the attached tags are determined

# Storefront
* Removed `shopware.config` variable, use `config('my_config_key')` instead
* Removed `shopware.theme` variable, use `theme_config('my_config_key')` instead
* Removed `shopware.theme.breakpoint`, use specific size variable instead `theme_config('breakpoint.sm')`

# Upgrade Information
## Twig system config access
The `shopware.config` variable was removed. To access a system config value inside twig, use `config('my_config_key')`.

## Twig theme config access
The `shopware.theme` variable was removed. To access the theme config value inside twig, use `theme_config('my_config_key')`.

## Theme breakpoint config array
The `shopware.theme.breakpoint` config value is no more available, please use the corresponding sizes. If you need to restore the array, you can use the following code:
```
{% set breakpoint = {
    'xs': theme_config('breakpoint.sm'),
    'sm': theme_config('breakpoint.md'),
    'md': theme_config('breakpoint.lg'),
    'lg': theme_config('breakpoint.xl')
} %}
```
