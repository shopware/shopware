# Administration
* Changed `getVariantFromPaymentState` method in `src/Administration/Resources/app/administration/src/module/sw-order/page/sw-order-list/index.js` to correct the variant for payment state.
* Added `transaction` method in `src/Administration/Resources/app/administration/src/module/sw-order/page/sw-order-list/index.js` to correct the label for payment state.
