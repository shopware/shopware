# Administration
* Changed snippet identifier `global.sw-multi-tag-ip-select.addIpAdress` to `global.sw-multi-tag-ip-select.addIpAddress`, due to a typo fix.
* Removed snippets of component `sw-multi-ip-select`, as it was removed with 6.4.0.0
    * Removed snippet key `global.sw-multi-ip-select.enterValidIp`
    * Removed snippet key `global.sw-multi-ip-select.addIpAddress`
