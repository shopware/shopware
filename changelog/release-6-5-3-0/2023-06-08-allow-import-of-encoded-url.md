# Upgrade Information
## MediaSerializer
### deserialize
The deserialize method of src/Core/Content/ImportExport/DataAbstractionLayer/Serializer/Entity/MediaSerializer.php was changed such that the filename will be urldecoded before saving it to the cacheMediaFiles.
Previously, encoded url raised an error during validateFileNameDoesNotContainForbiddenCharacter when importing them, because they contained % signs. 
On the other hand, not encoding urls raised an "Invalid media url" exception.

This change allows importing medias with filenames that contain special characters by supplying an encoded url in the import file.
