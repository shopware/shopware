title: Upgrade to symfony 7
issue: NEXT-30687
---
# Core
* Changed symfony version to 7.0, for now only `symfony/console` component is still allowed in v6.4, because of an [issue with composer](https://github.com/composer/composer/issues/11736), but we will increase the minimum version there as well when the composer issue is resolved.
* Removed parent class `MessageSubscriberInterface` from abstract `ScheduledTaskHandler` class, use #[AsMessageHandler] attribute instead
* Removed unused class `Shopware\Core\Framework\Struct\Serializer\StructDecoder`
* Removed `CommandTestBehaviour` test trait, use symfony's `CommandTester` instead
* Removed dependency on `dg/bypass-finals` package and removed `bypassFinals` on `TestBootstrapper`
