# Upgrade Information
## Administration Node.js version change

To use the administration it's now mandatory that your node version is the current LTS version `20` (`Iron`).
If you use `devenv` or `nvm`, you just need to update your session as our configuration files are configured to use the correct version.
Otherwise, you need to update your node installation manually.
