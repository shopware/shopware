# Storefront
* Changed in `src/Storefront/Resources/app/storefront/src/scss/component/_address-editor.scss` to make `address-editor-modal` has the same style in both 6.6 and 6.7 version.
* Changed in `src/Storefront/Resources/app/storefront/src/scss/page/account/_address.scss` to make icon center with action button.
