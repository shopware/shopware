# Storefront
* Changed `src/Storefront/Resources/app/storefront/build/start-hot-reload.js` to check via `accept` headers if the current request is the HTML document. `sec-fetch-dest` is not available via http.
* Changed `src/Storefront/Resources/app/storefront/webpack.config.js` to only skip themes that are not used in a ChildTheme via script assets.
