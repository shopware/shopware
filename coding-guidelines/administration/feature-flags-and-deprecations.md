# Administration feature flags and deprecations

Follow the general feature-flag rules in [core feature flags](../core/feature-flags.md). These Administration-specific rules cover JavaScript, Vue, and Admin extension APIs.

## Feature flags

- Use feature flags for temporary rollout or deprecation branches, not as permanent configuration.
- Use uppercase flag names for Administration JavaScript flags, for example `V6_8_0_0` or `ADMIN_COMPOSITION_API_EXTENSION_SYSTEM`.
- Keep each flag focused on one behavior or migration path.
- Avoid nested feature flags; they create hard-to-test state combinations.
- Keep the old behavior inside the branch that will be deleted when the flag is removed.
- Test both relevant flag states when both branches are still supported.

## Deprecations

- Mark deprecated Administration APIs with `@deprecated tag:vX.Y.Z - ...` and name the replacement.
- Add runtime deprecation warnings for developer-facing APIs when callers need migration feedback.
- Document the migration path when deprecating public Administration extension points.
- Do not introduce new internal callers of deprecated APIs; move core/Admin code to the replacement.
- When removing a flag, remove the legacy branch, flag configuration, obsolete tests, and stale documentation in the same change.
