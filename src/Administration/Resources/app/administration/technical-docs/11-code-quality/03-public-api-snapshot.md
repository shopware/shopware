# Public API snapshot

> Status: In-Progress

The Administration gets a generated snapshot of its public API and a check that blocks unannounced breaks, see [#22591](https://github.com/shopware/shopware/issues/22591).
Both are built in steps.
The markers that announce a change exist so far.
The grammar of the markers is in `eslint-rules/deprecation-rules/utils/api-markers.ts`.

## Markers

A marker is a comment on the element it announces a change for.
`@deprecated` is for an element that is removed or replaced, so plugins can migrate now.
`@bc-change` is for a planned change to an element that stays.
It is a tag of its own because the extension ESLint preset reports every use of a `@deprecated` element as an error, and here plugins have nothing to migrate to.

```text
@deprecated tag:vX.Y.Z - <text>
@bc-change <Kind> version:vX.Y.Z [<key>:<value> ...]
  <text>
```

```js
/**
 * @bc-change ParameterRemoval version:v6.8.0 parameter:itemIndex
 *   The template stops passing the index. Use this.lineItems.indexOf(item).
 */
onDeleteItem(item, itemIndex) {
```

```twig
{# @bc-change BlockMoved version:v6.8.0 parent:sw_order_detail_state_card_state_select #}
{% block sw_order_detail_state_card_state_history_text %}
```

- A tag counts when it starts a line of a JSDoc comment, a line comment, a Twig comment or an HTML comment.
  A mention inside a sentence is not a marker.
- No punctuation follows the tag name, so `@deprecated:` and `@deprecated,` are reported.
- The version has three parts, as in `coding-guidelines/core/backward-compatibility.md`.
- A value ends at the next space, so it contains none.
  Write a type without spaces, as in `type:string|null`.
- The text of a `@deprecated` is required and follows the version after `- ` on the same line.
- The text of a `@bc-change` starts on the line after the marker.

| Kind | Announces | Keys |
|---|---|---|
| `ParameterRemoval` | A method loses a parameter | `parameter` |
| `NewRequiredParameter` | A method gets a required parameter, or an optional one becomes required | `parameter` |
| `ParameterDefaultValueChange` | The default value of a parameter changes | `parameter`, `default` |
| `ReturnTypeNarrowing` | A method or computed property returns a narrower type | `type` |
| `ReturnTypeWidening` | A method or computed property returns a wider type | `type` |
| `BecomesPrivate` | A public element becomes `@private` | none |
| `BlockMoved` | A block moves under another parent block | `parent` |
| `ScopeVariableRemoval` | A block loses a template variable from a `v-for` or a slot | `variable` |
| `PropBecomesRequired` | An optional prop becomes required | none |
| `EmitPayloadChange` | The payload of an event changes | none |
| `RouteParentChange` | A route moves under another parent route, or to the top level | `parent` |
| `RegistryGroupChange` | A registry entry, for example a rule condition, moves to another group | `group` |

The first five kinds have the names of the PHP attributes in `src/Core/Framework/Deprecation/BCChange/`.
Their keys are shorter than the PHP arguments, for example `parameter` for `parameterName` and `type` for `newType`.
`BecomesPrivate` is what PHP calls `BecomesInternal`.
The other kinds exist only in the Administration.
The list of kinds can still change until the break check uses them.

`eslint-rules/deprecation-rules/utils/api-markers.ts` holds the grammar and the kinds.
The ESLint rule `sw-deprecation-rules/valid-api-markers` uses it and reports, in `.js`, `.ts`, `.vue` and `.html.twig` files:

- a typo in the tag name one edit away, such as `@bc-chnage` or `@deprecate`
- a missing or malformed version
- an unknown kind
- a missing key, or a key the kind does not take

Without the rule such a comment would stay a plain comment, and the change would surface as an unannounced break in the major.

Only the format is checked so far.
Whether a marker sits on an element its kind fits, and whether its version is not released yet, comes with the break check.
