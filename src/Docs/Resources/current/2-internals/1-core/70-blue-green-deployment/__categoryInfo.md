### Blue-green Deployment

Blue-green deployment is a technique that reduces downtime and risk by running multiple identical production environments and ensures this environments are compatible to each other while updating.
To be able to provide Blue-green Deployment in Shopware your Database needs the ability and the permission to run Triggers. When Blue-green Deployment is set to false,
no Triggers are needed, but you cannot update multiple envionments without a downtime.
