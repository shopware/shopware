To extend a language in Shopware 6 you can add your own snippets in your theme.
You can also add a completely new language to Shopware 6.

## General snippet structure

To organize your snippets you can add them to `.json` files, so structuring and finding snippets you want to change is very easy. 

## Adding snippets

You can add new snippets by adding files to the follow structure like this:

```
# move into your theme folder
$ cd custom/plugins/MyTheme

# structure of theme
└─ src
   ├─ Resources
   │  ├─ config
   │  │  └─ services.xml
   │  └─ snippet
   │     ├─ de_DE
   │     │  ├─ SnippetFile_de_DE.php
   │     │  └─ storefront.de-DE.json
   │     └─ en_GB
   │        ├─ SnippetFile_en_GB.php
   │        └─ storefront.en-GB.json
   └─ MyTheme.php
```

There is no explicit syntax for variables in the storefront. It is nevertheless recommended to encompass them with `%`
symbols to be extra clear on what their purpose is. Pluralization works for any natural number. Just remember to explicitly
define the intervals' amounts and ranges for that snippet.

Example of `src/Resources/snippet/storefront.en-GB.json`:
```json
{
    "my-theme": {
        "productDetail": {
            "headLineText": "There are %count% discounts available for %product%:",
            "description": "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consetetur sadipscing elitr, sed diam ..."
        },
        "cart": {
            "itemCounter": "{1} 1 discount item | ]1,Inf[ %count% discount items"
        }
    }
}
```

## Autoloading of Storefront snippets

*Attention: This only works since Shopware 6.2.3 onwards.*

Shopware is able to automatically load your snippet files if you stick to some convention regarding file structure and naming.
For this to work you have to store your snippet files in the `src/Resources/snippet` directory of your plugin, but you can use subdirectories if you want to.
Additionally you have to name your snippet way the same way as it should be displayed in the administration. Therefore use the naming pattern `<name>.<locale>`, where you can freely define the name part. 
The locale part must map to the ISO string of the supported locale in this snippet file.
If you provide base translations, meaning that you ship translations for a whole new language, you indicate it with a `.base` suffix in your file name.
Keep in mind that in this case also have to use the `messages` name, so your complete filename may look like this: `messages.<locale>.base.json`.
Lastly if your snippets are autoloaded the author information provided in your composer file will be used as the author of the snippets.

If you need more freedom in configuring your snippets read on.

## Configuring Storefront snippets

*Attention: since Shopware 6.2.3 this is not necessary anymore and it will be removed in Shopware 6.4.*

Storefront snippets additionally require a class that extends the `SnippetFileInterface`.
A suitable name would e.g. be `SnippetFile_en_GB.php`. Having created that file, you will have to implement the following five methods:

- `getName`: Returns the name of the snippet file as a string. By referring to this name, you can access the translations later.
It is **required** to use `messages.en-GB`, if you provide a whole new language. By default, an extension should call its
Storefront extension `storefront.en-GB`. Otherwise a describing domain, like shopware's PayPal plugin using `paypal.en-GB`,
is also okay.
- `getPath`: Each SnippetFile class has to point to the `.json` file, that contains the actual translations. Return its
path here. We suggest using the name already chosen in `getName` for your file name.
- `getIso`: Return the ISO string of the supported locale here. This is important, because the `Translator` collects every
snippet file with this locale and merges them to generate the snippet catalogue used by the storefront. 
- `getAuthor`: Return your vendor name here. This can be used to distinguish your snippets from all the other
available ones. The Administration snippet set module offers a filter, so users are able to easily find plugin specific snippets.
- `isBase`: Return `true` here, if your theme implements a whole new language, such as providing french snippets for the
whole Shopware 6 system. Don't forget to watch your `getName` method then. Most of the time, you're just adding your own snippets to an existent language, then `false` will be
your way to go.

Example for the language `en-GB` :
```php
<?php declare(strict_types=1);

namespace MyTheme\Resources\snippet\en_GB;

use Shopware\Core\System\Snippet\Files\SnippetFileInterface;

class SnippetFile_en_GB implements SnippetFileInterface
{
    public function getName(): string
    {
        return 'storefront.en-GB';
    }

    public function getPath(): string
    {
        return __DIR__ . '/storefront.en-GB.json';
    }

    public function getIso(): string
    {
        return 'en-GB';
    }

    public function getAuthor(): string
    {
        return 'Enter developer name here';
    }

    public function isBase(): bool
    {
        return false;
    }
}
```

#### Registering your service

Lastly you have to register your snippet files by creating file `src/Resources/config/services.xml`.

Example:
```xml
<!-- src/Resources/config/services.xml -->
<?xml version="1.0" ?>

<container xmlns="http://symfony.com/schema/dic/services"
           xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
           xsi:schemaLocation="http://symfony.com/schema/dic/services http://symfony.com/schema/dic/services/services-1.0.xsd">

    <!-- Translations -->
    <services>
        <service id="MyTheme\Resources\snippet\en_GB\SnippetFile_en_GB" public="true">
            <tag name="shopware.snippet.file"/>
        </service>
    </services>

    <services>
        <service id="MyTheme\Resources\snippet\de_DE\SnippetFile_de_DE" public="true">
            <tag name="shopware.snippet.file"/>
        </service>
    </services>
</container>
```

## Using your snippets in your templates

With the `trans` filter you can use your snippets in the twig templates and they will be translated automatically.
You also can pass values to replace the placeholders in the snippets.

```twig
    <div class="product-detail-headline">
        {{ 'my-theme.productDetail.headLineText' | trans({'%count%': count, '%product%': product}) }}
    </div>
```
