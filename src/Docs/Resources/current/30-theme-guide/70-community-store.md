To publish your plugins in the Shopware Community Store, you need to register your own developer prefix in your Shopware account.

After that process you can compile your created theme, then create a zip file of the folder and upload your theme to the Shopware Community Store.

# Compile a theme

```bash
# run this to compile your theme
$ bin/console theme:compile
```
