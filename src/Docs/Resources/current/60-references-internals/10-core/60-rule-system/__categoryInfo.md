[titleEn]: <>(Rule system)
[hash]: <>(category:rule)

*It is highly recommended to - first - read the [cart documentation](./../50-checkout-process/10-cart.md)*

The rule system pervades Shopware 6. It solves the problem of calculating the cart differently based on the context (`SalesChannel`, `CustomerGroup`, `...`) and the current state (`LineItems`, `Amount`, `...`), but user controlled and decoupled from the cart itself. In theory [every part of Shopware 6](./10-rule-list.md) can contribute to the set of available rules.

### Scenario

The problem solved by the rule system can be imagined by the following scenario:

> If a customer orders a car, a pair of sunglasses in the same order will be free.

This carelessly uttered sentence relies on the knowledge of multiple different data points:

* A product called *car*
* A product called *sunglasses*

Both independent and separately buyable. Stored to the database.

* The whole state of a single cart
* The quantity of a line item

A runtime concept - in memory.

Resulting in the adjustment of a single line items price, which in turn changes the whole **calculation of the cart**.

In this example the rule system sits right in the middle of the scenario, providing the necessary mapping information to get from *point a* (`car` is in the cart) to *point b* (`sunglasses` are free).

### Rule Design

The center of the rule system is the [`Rule`](https://github.com/shopware/platform/blob/master/src/Core/Framework/Rule/Rule.php), it is realized as a variant of the  [Specification pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specification_pattern), but omits the name due to a few key differences.

* *Storable* and *retrievable* and **identifiable** through the [Data Abstraction Layer](./../10-erd/erd-shopware-core-content-rule.md)
* A `RuleScope` parameter instead of any arbitrary object
* `match` instead of `isSatisfiedBy`

As well as a *Specification class*, a *Rule class* represents a condition to fulfill. It implements the `match(RuleScope $scope)` function to validate *user defined values* against a *runtime state*. See the following object diagram for a better understanding:

![rule objects](./dist/rule-objects.png)

Which will result in the following call order:

![rule state diagram](./dist/rule-sequence.png)

As you can see a single rule can either contain user defined values or other, user defined, rules. These are *Container rules*. The rule system here bears some resemblance to the [SearchCriteria](./../130-dal.md), although independent. Where a criteria is the representation of a query that gets translated and executed through the storage engine, the rule matches **in memory** in PHP.

The last building block then is the **Rule Scope**. The Scope contains the current runtime state of the application and is necessary to match the data. The whole picture is visualized in the next diagram:

![rule classes](./dist/rule-classes.png)

### Connection to the System

Following Shopware 6s data driven approach the rule objects are stored to the [database](./../10-erd/erd-shopware-core-content-rule.md) and used to trigger behaviour in the cart through the associations present.
