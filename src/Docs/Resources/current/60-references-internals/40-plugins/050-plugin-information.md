To provide Shopware and the shop owner with information about your plugin, you have to supply a `composer.json` with your plugin.
Some information are gathered through the default properties of a `composer.json`.
For some Shopware specific information, you have to extend the `extra` property.
Have a look at the [composer schema](https://getcomposer.org/doc/04-schema.md), to learn more about the properties.

## Example `composer.json`

```json

## Requirements

The `require` field in the composer.json file defines on which dependencies your plugin relies.
As you want to develop a plugin for Shopware, you should have at least an entry for `shopware/core` here.
If you also rely on other parts of Shopware 6 you should als require them, e.g. `shopware/storefront`.
In addition to that, it is also possible to define dependencies on other plugins or even every other composer package.

## Translations

Some fields of the plugin entity are translatable.
Shopware will try to match each of your provided translations with an existing language in the system.
For more information about the translation system in Shopware have look [here](./../10-core/130-dal.md).
Your translation locale code must look like that "de-DE", "en-GB", "de-CH", etc.
If a language with this locale is not available, the translation will not be written.

## Changelog

The changelog for your plugin now has to be located in another file.
Have as look at our [changelog guide](./060-plugin-changelog.md) to figure out how that's done in Shopware 6.

## Icon

A plugin can have an icon which will be rendered in the shopware administration. The default path for an icon is `src/Resources/config/plugin.png` relative from the plugin root folder. This path can be overridden using the `extra` object in the `composer.json` as follows:
```json
{
    "extra": {
        "plugin-icon": "myFolder/icon.png"
    }
}
```
The icon should be a png file with the size 40 x 40 px. Since it is stored in the database as `mediumblob` the theoretical max file size is 16 MB.
