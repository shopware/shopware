## Overview

The Admin API can be used to complete all administrative tasks, like creating products, updating prices and much more.

The Admin API makes it really easy to integrate *Shopware* into your environment.

## Versioning

The Admin API is versioned by adding a version string to the query path. Currently, the only available version is **v1**.

## Schema overview

All HTTP methods follow the usual REST behavior.
**GET** on a resource retrieves the resource.
**POST** adds a new resource. **PATCH** updates some attributes of a resource.
**DELETE** removes a resource.

The resources are all namedÂ in singular. Only the 1-n and n-m relation names of sub-resources are pluralized.
For example: **/api/v3/category** and **/api/v3/category/products**.

Some examples:

### Sub-resources

All relationships are exposed as sub-resources. Only the **GET** method is allowed for sub-resources.

### Identifier

All identifiers are [UUIDs Version 4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier#Version_4_\(random\)).
You can generate the UUIDs yourself or let the API backend generate them for you by leaving them out in the request body.
