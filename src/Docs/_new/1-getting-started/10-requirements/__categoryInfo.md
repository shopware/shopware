[titleEn]: <>(Requirements)

Before installing the Shopware Platform you should take a quick look at the requirements to check if your local environment is capable of running Shopware.

## System Requirements

### Operating System

Although the Shopware Platform should support most unix like environments, we recommend using **Ubuntu 18.04 LTS** or  **macOS Mojave 10.14** to get the best experience.

### Environment

PHP
*  7.2 or higher
* `memory_limit` 512M minimum
* `max_execution_time` 30 seconds minimum
* Extensions: 
    * ext-dom  
    * ext-fileinfo  
    * ext-gd  
    * ext-iconv  
    * ext-intl  
    * ext-json  
    * ext-libxml  
    * ext-mbstring  
    * ext-openssl  
    * ext-pcre  
    * ext-pdo  
    * ext-pdo_mysql  
    * ext-phar  
    * ext-simplexml  
    * ext-xml  
    * ext-zip  
    * ext-zlib  
* Composer 1.6 or higher

SQL
* MySQL 5.7.21 or higher
* MariaDB 10.3 or higher
* With configuration `group_concat_max_len=320000`
    
JavaScript
* Node.js 8.10.0 or higher
* NPM 6.5.0 or higher

Various
* Apache 2.4 or higher with mod-rewrite enabled 
* Bash
* Git

### Recommendations

- Zend Opcache (256M or more)
- APCu (128M or more)
- Webserver with HTTP2 support

Adminer (https://www.adminer.org/) is our recommended database administration tool since it has better support for binary data types.

## Docker

If you are working on Linux there is a curated docker setup, that takes care of setting up the environment for you.

In this case you need:

* PHP 7.2+ CLI
* docker
* docker-compose
* bash
