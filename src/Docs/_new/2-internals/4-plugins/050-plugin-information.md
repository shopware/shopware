[titleEn]: <>(Plugin meta information)

To provide Shopware and the shop owner with information about your plugin, you have to supply a `composer.json` with your plugin.
Some information are gathered through the default properties of a `composer.json`.
For some Shopware specific information, you have to extend the `extra` property.
Have a look at the [composer schema](https://getcomposer.org/doc/04-schema.md), to learn more about the properties.

## Example `composer.json`

## Translations

Some fields of the plugin entity are translatable.
Shopware will try to match each of your provided translations with an existing language in the system.

If a language with this locale is not available, the translation will not be written.
