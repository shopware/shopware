Getting started
---------

To compile the assets (scss/javascript) you have to run the webpack compiler.
This is easily done by executing the following commands in the shopware root folder via the `psh.phar`.

- storefront:dev        Builds the project for development
- storefront:hot        Starts the hot module reloading serve
- storefront:install    Installs the node.js dependencies
- storefront:build      Builds the project for production
- storefront:watch      Starts the webpack watcher

For example:
```
$ ./psh.phar storefront:dev
```

It's recommended to use the `storefront:watch` command when developing, so the files will be compiled as soon as they change.

It's also possible to use the webpack-dev-server with hot module reloading (HMR) activated.
To be able to use HMR you have to run the command `storefront:hot` and set the `isHMRMode` variable,
located in `platform/src/Storefront/Resources/views/storefront/base.html.twig`, to true.
