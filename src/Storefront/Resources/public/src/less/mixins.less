/*
Mixins
==================================================
The `mixins.less` file contains the imports to all mixin documents that simplify the work with Shopware.

Mixin specific documentation can be found inside each mixin file.

Mixins can be used by adding the mixin class onto an element inside Shopware.

**Example:**<br/>
`.border-radius(3px);`
