# Config generated with Ludtwig v0.8.0
# -------------------------------
# Ludtwig documentation
# -------------------------------

# To override any of the config values with environment variables use the following format:
# LUDTWIG_FORMAT__INDENTATION_COUNT=1

# To exclude any files / directories from ludtwig you can use `.ludtwig-ignore` files anywhere in the file tree
# These are evaluated just like .gitignore files (which are also considered by ludtwig!)

# Ludtwig does support directives as html and twig comments like
# <!-- ludtwig-ignore-file rule1, rule2, rule3 -->
# {# ludtwig-ignore-file rule1, rule2, rule3 #}

# Ignoring whole files from ludtwig is possible by adding the comment
# {# ludtwig-ignore-file #}
# on top of the file. You can also only ignore specific rules for a file with
# {# ludtwig-ignore-file indentation, twig-block-line-breaks #}

# Ignoring specific errors / warnings is possible by adding the comment
# {# ludtwig-ignore #}
# or
# {# ludtwig-ignore twig-block-name-snake-case #}
# before the problematic element.
# This will ignore also all children (the whole next SyntaxNode)!
